Appreciation post - #THEODINPROJECT(a free resource to learn web development)

It's my first time writing an article and it will be for #theodinproject, 2 years ago I started researching more on web development (specifically Front-End) and there were infinite resources but somehow they were lacking on some essential topics or some of them were overpriced.

Before that, I was good at C Programming and Python but I had never touched Javascript so through Odin Project I learned nearly everything a developer needs to be hired and to be able to work and do projects. It was this platform that helped me gain understanding, learn some concepts then throw on me projects that I needed to work out on my own and with much research to finish them, meanwhile, my GitHub repositories were growing.

I am writing this post just because it is a really game-changer together with #fullstackopen for any aspiring web developer not just to enter this world but to get better at it also.
